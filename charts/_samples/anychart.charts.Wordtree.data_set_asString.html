            'According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. ' +
            'Earth\'s gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth\'s only natural satellite. ' +
            'Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. ' +
            'During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times. ' +
            'Earth\'s axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. ' +
            'The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth\'s orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. ' +
            'Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. ' +
            'Earth\'s lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. ' +
            'About 71% of Earth\'s surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. ' +
            'The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. ' +
            'The majority of Earth\'s polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. ' +
            'Earth\'s interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth\'s magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics. '
